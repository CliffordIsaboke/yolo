To update configuration within 30 seconds on all servers and roll back to any previous configuration within 30 seconds, we can use a combination of Ansible and Git.

We can store the nginx configuration in a Git repository and use Ansible to automate the configuration deployment process. The configuration files will be pulled from Git and deployed on all the servers in a rolling fashion to minimize the downtime. We can use Ansible's serial and max_fail_percentage parameters to control the rate at which the configuration is applied and to ensure that the deployment is halted if a certain percentage of servers fail to update.

For visibility on the progress, we can use Ansible's built-in logging and notification mechanisms to track the deployment progress and notify stakeholders of any issues. We can also use a dashboard to visualize the deployment progress across different geographical regions.

To ensure a gradual change based on geographical regions, we can divide the servers into different groups based on their location and use Ansible's group-based deployment feature to apply the configuration changes in a specific order.

Main Challenges:

The main challenges in this solution are the scale and the speed at which the configuration needs to be updated. Updating 1,000,000 servers within 30 seconds requires a highly scalable and efficient solution.

Another challenge is the rollback process. Rolling back the configuration to a previous version within 30 seconds requires a reliable and fast mechanism to store and retrieve the configuration changes.

Alternatives:

Other alternatives to this solution include using a configuration management tool like Puppet or Chef, or using a container orchestration tool like Kubernetes to manage the nginx servers.

Prototype:

For a small-scale prototype, we can use a test environment with three nginx servers and configure them with Ansible and Git. We can simulate the configuration deployment and rollback process and test the performance and reliability of the solution.
